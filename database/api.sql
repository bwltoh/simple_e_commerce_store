Diamond Clarity:No two diamonds are alike. A diamond\'s most distinguishing characteristics are its inclusions, marks that are often invisible to the naked eye. However, under a jeweler\'s magnifying loupe or microscope they can look like crystals, tiny rivers, or clouds. A diamond\'s clarity is determined by the presence or absence of inclusions--fewer inclusions mean better clarity--and how visible they are. The greater a diamond\'s clarity, the greater its brilliance and value. A diamond categorized as internally flawless will have no inclusions, but this is extremely rare.Diamond Color:Though diamonds come in a wide range of colors, colorless diamonds have traditionally been considered the most valuable. Most diamonds are graded on a scale using the letters of the alphabet, from D (colorless), the best grade, through Z (a light yellow). It is difficult for the untrained eye to notice such variations in color unless stones are being compared side by side.Diamond Carat Weight:A diamond\'s weight is measured in carats, with one carat being equivalent to 100 points. You will often see a diamond referred to as a 3/4-carat stone or a 75-point diamond. Larger stones are often more highly valued, but size should not be the only consideration--high brilliance, which varies according to clarity, cut, and color grade, is highly desirable in a diamond.Diamond Certification:A diamond certificate represents independent verification that the stone purchased has all the qualities of cut, color, clarity, shape, and weight expected. It is a further indication of the condition and value of that diamond as represented on our site. Such certificates are issued by several agencies employing highly trained gemologists and provide an unbiased and accurate evaluation of the diamond. These gemologists scrutinize each stone to analyze its dimensions, clarity, cut, color, finish, symmetry, and other details.Diamonds purchased from the Amazon.com Collection may be certified by the Gemological Institute of America or the International Gemological Institute. The type of certificate provided will be noted in the product specifications of your jewelry purchase; if you do not see a certificate type noted, one will not be provided.Our Diamond Policy:Amazon.com sources high-quality diamonds from some of the world\'s largest suppliers. All our diamond suppliers certify that to their best knowledge their diamonds are not conflict diamonds.Diamond Care:Diamonds, as the hardest substance on earth, are resistant to damage. However, diamond jewelry is set in different metals, and care will vary from piece to piece. Diamonds should be cleaned in a solution of one part ammonia to six parts water, using a gentle scrubbing brush to remove any dirt. It is a good idea to have them cleaned once a year by a professional jeweler, at which time the security of the setting can be checked as well. Diamond jewelry should be stored in a soft cloth pouch to ensure that the stone will not scratch other jewelry.', '350.00', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Oi-zho-tL.jpg', 65, 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Sterling Silver HistoryExperts believe that silver alloy, used today as sterling silver, originated in continental Europe in the 12th century. Pure silver was found to be a soft and easily damageable material. When combined with other metals, most commonly cooper, it produced a tougher material that could be heavily relied on. Throughout the next few centuries, sterling silver was used as currency and for household items. It was often used as silverware and became the material used in a proper table setting between 1840 and 1940 throughout the United States and Europe. Because of this popularity, silver companies began to grow. During this craze, companies began to experiment using sterling silver compositions in jewelry, as it was a material that was easy to mold into intricate designs and gave a luxurious look with its metallic finish. Today, sterling silver is widely used in all kinds of jewelry styles and shines as beautifully as other precious metals, with the benefit of affordable pricing.Sterling Silver CompositionWhile pure silver can be combined with many different types of metals, sterling silver is created when combining pure silver with copper. Sterling silver jewelry can be composed with different amounts of copper but is most often seen with the .925 stamp, meaning that the composition is of 92.5 percent silver and 7.5 percent copper. This has been found to be a good combination for maintaining the silver\'s durability without harming its sparkle.Caring for Your Sterling Silver JewelrySilver should not come into contact with harsh household chemicals such as bleach, ammonia, or chlorine. To avoid scratches, store silver in a lined jewelry box or pouch, as it is prone to tarnish as it naturally reacts with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide in the air. Cleaning and wearing silver jewelry regularly will prevent this and help maintain its shine. Immediately upon noticing any discoloration, use a gentle polish made specifically for removing tarnish.', '45.67', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xpmY9ekRL.jpg', 33, 2, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

August Birthstone: PeridotThe lively light green hue of August\'s birthstone conveys positive energy and optimism, and those born in August are said to be happy, generous people. Peridot is also believed to promote tranquility, enhance speech, and foster good relationships in marriage.History of BirthstonesChances are you can name your birthstone, but have you ever wondered how certain stones came to be associated with particular months? Most gem scholars trace the tradition to the Old Testament story of Aaron, whose breastplate was decorated with twelve precious stones, one for each of the twelve tribes of Israel. Over time, these stones were linked with certain powers and tied to particular astrological signs, and later to calendar months.There are many variations of birthstone lists, including Mystical birthstones, which originate from Tibet and date back over a thousand years, and Ayurvedic birthstones, associated with ancient Indian medicine and beliefs. Birthstones have also been tied to ancient Pagan religions, and even to the collective wisdom of the legendary lost city of Atlantis.The modern birthstone list, perhaps the most universally known, was released by the American National Association of Jewelers and officially adopted in 1912. Whether you embrace birthstone lore, or look upon it with a skeptical eye, there is an undeniable appeal to collecting a beautiful gemstone that is reputed to hold special power, meaning, and good fortune just for you.', '68.08', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41rRwhr8LOL.jpg', 73, 4, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Diamond Clarity:No two diamonds are alike. A diamond\'s most distinguishing characteristics are its inclusions, marks that are often invisible to the naked eye. However, under a jeweler\'s magnifying loupe or microscope they can look like crystals, tiny rivers, or clouds. A diamond\'s clarity is determined by the presence or absence of inclusions--fewer inclusions mean better clarity--and how visible they are. The greater a diamond\'s clarity, the greater its brilliance and value. A diamond categorized as internally flawless will have no inclusions, but this is extremely rare.Diamond Color:Though diamonds come in a wide range of colors, colorless diamonds have traditionally been considered the most valuable. Most diamonds are graded on a scale using the letters of the alphabet, from D (colorless), the best grade, through Z (a light yellow). It is difficult for the untrained eye to notice such variations in color unless stones are being compared side by side.Diamond Carat Weight:A diamond\'s weight is measured in carats, with one carat being equivalent to 100 points. You will often see a diamond referred to as a 3/4-carat stone or a 75-point diamond. Larger stones are often more highly valued, but size should not be the only consideration--high brilliance, which varies according to clarity, cut, and color grade, is highly desirable in a diamond.Diamond Certification:A diamond certificate represents independent verification that the stone purchased has all the qualities of cut, color, clarity, shape, and weight expected. It is a further indication of the condition and value of that diamond as represented on our site. Such certificates are issued by several agencies employing highly trained gemologists and provide an unbiased and accurate evaluation of the diamond. These gemologists scrutinize each stone to analyze its dimensions, clarity, cut, color, finish, symmetry, and other details.Diamonds purchased from the Amazon.com Collection may be certified by the Gemological Institute of America or the International Gemological Institute. The type of certificate provided will be noted in the product specifications of your jewelry purchase; if you do not see a certificate type noted, one will not be provided.Our Diamond Policy:Amazon.com sources high-quality diamonds from some of the world\'s largest suppliers. All our diamond suppliers certify that to their best knowledge their diamonds are not conflict diamonds.Diamond Care:Diamonds, as the hardest substance on earth, are resistant to damage. However, diamond jewelry is set in different metals, and care will vary from piece to piece. Diamonds should be cleaned in a solution of one part ammonia to six parts water, using a gentle scrubbing brush to remove any dirt. It is a good idea to have them cleaned once a year by a professional jeweler, at which time the security of the setting can be checked as well. Diamond jewelry should be stored in a soft cloth pouch to ensure that the stone will not scratch other jewelry.', '167.20', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SPpGsorUL.jpg', 88, 5, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

About Sterling Silver JewelrySterling Silver HistoryExperts believe that silver alloy, used today as sterling silver, originated in continental Europe in the 12th century. Pure silver was found to be a soft and easily damageable material. When combined with other metals, most commonly cooper, it produced a tougher material that could be heavily relied on. Throughout the next few centuries, sterling silver was used as currency and for household items. It was often used as silverware and became the material used in a proper table setting between 1840 and 1940 throughout the United States and Europe. Because of this popularity, silver companies began to grow. During this craze, companies began to experiment using sterling silver compositions in jewelry, as it was a material that was easy to mold into intricate designs and gave a luxurious look with its metallic finish. Today, sterling silver is widely used in all kinds of jewelry styles and shines as beautifully as other precious metals, with the benefit of affordable pricing.Sterling Silver CompositionWhile pure silver can be combined with many different types of metals, sterling silver is created when combining pure silver with copper. Sterling silver jewelry can be composed with different amounts of copper but is most often seen with the .925 stamp, meaning that the composition is of 92.5 percent silver and 7.5 percent copper. This has been found to be a good combination for maintaining the silver\'s durability without harming its sparkle.Caring for Your Sterling Silver JewelrySilver should not come into contact with harsh household chemicals such as bleach, ammonia, or chlorine. To avoid scratches, store silver in a lined jewelry box or pouch, as it is prone to tarnish as it naturally reacts with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide in the air. Cleaning and wearing silver jewelry regularly will prevent this and help maintain its shine. Immediately upon noticing any discoloration, use a gentle polish made specifically for removing tarnish.', '29.00', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Vj8pq9vXL.jpg', 62, 5, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Cubic ZirconiaHistoryIn 1937, Cubic Zirconia was first discovered by German mineralogists, M. V. Stackelberg and K. Chudoba. Little did they know, the tiny crystals that they discovered would move on to become a popular synthetic gemstone. It wasn’t until the 1970s that Cubic Zirconia was first used in the jewelry world, when scientists began growing the crystals in the laboratory. In the 1980s, Cubic Zirconia use in jewelry continued to grow and today is it one of the most popular diamond substitutes available on the market.CompositionCubic Zirconia is the cubic form of zirconium oxide that is created in a laboratory. Its durable material allows the synthetic stone to be molded into a variety of shapes. The stone offers brilliant shine and flawless clarity. Cubic Zirconia is available in a wide range of colors, including a colorless form that is an economically important competitor to natural diamonds.Caring For Your Cubic Zirconia JewelryLike natural diamonds, Cubic Zirconia needs to be cared for in order to maintain its original brilliance and shine. Clean with warm-to-hot water and a soft brush with a mild soap, then immediately dry with a clean cloth after rinsing. Avoid contact with perfume, body lotion, hairspray or any other chemical that may harm the shine of the stone.', '30.00', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Y2SQOxaJL.jpg', 85, 7, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

He crafts this braided bracelet with black leather, centering it with a realistic jaguar made from sterling silver. Mexico\'s ancient Maya revered the little cat, which they called a tigrillo, or \"little tiger.\"About our Artist: Guillermo Arregui settled in Mexico after years of traveling: \'By chance, in 1985, my wife and I went to Taxco where we met a silversmith who opened the doors of his workshop to me. I learned everything. I get my inspiration from everything that surrounds me and, obviously, from all my traveling. I love natural stones. I cut them and do everything myself.

Sterling Silver HistoryExperts believe that silver alloy, used today as sterling silver, originated in continental Europe in the 12th century. Pure silver was found to be a soft and easily damageable material. When combined with other metals, most commonly cooper, it produced a tougher material that could be heavily relied on. Throughout the next few centuries, sterling silver was used as currency and for household items. It was often used as silverware and became the material used in a proper table setting between 1840 and 1940 throughout the United States and Europe. Because of this popularity, silver companies began to grow. During this craze, companies began to experiment using sterling silver compositions in jewelry, as it was a material that was easy to mold into intricate designs and gave a luxurious look with its metallic finish. Today, sterling silver is widely used in all kinds of jewelry styles and shines as beautifully as other precious metals, with the benefit of affordable pricing.Sterling Silver CompositionWhile pure silver can be combined with many different types of metals, sterling silver is created when combining pure silver with copper. Sterling silver jewelry can be composed with different amounts of copper but is most often seen with the .925 stamp, meaning that the composition is of 92.5 percent silver and 7.5 percent copper. This has been found to be a good combination for maintaining the silver\'s durability without harming its sparkle.Caring for Your Sterling Silver JewelrySilver should not come into contact with harsh household chemicals such as bleach, ammonia, or chlorine. To avoid scratches, store silver in a lined jewelry box or pouch, as it is prone to tarnish as it naturally reacts with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide in the air. Cleaning and wearing silver jewelry regularly will prevent this and help maintain its shine. Immediately upon noticing any discoloration, use a gentle polish made specifically for removing tarnish.', '19.00', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31BGPQncylL.jpg', 63, 8, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Diamond Clarity:No two diamonds are alike. A diamond\'s most distinguishing characteristics are its inclusions, marks that are often invisible to the naked eye. However, under a jeweler\'s magnifying loupe or microscope they can look like crystals, tiny rivers, or clouds. A diamond\'s clarity is determined by the presence or absence of inclusions--fewer inclusions mean better clarity--and how visible they are. The greater a diamond\'s clarity, the greater its brilliance and value. A diamond categorized as internally flawless will have no inclusions, but this is extremely rare.Diamond Color:Though diamonds come in a wide range of colors, colorless diamonds have traditionally been considered the most valuable. Most diamonds are graded on a scale using the letters of the alphabet, from D (colorless), the best grade, through Z (a light yellow). It is difficult for the untrained eye to notice such variations in color unless stones are being compared side by side.Diamond Carat Weight:A diamond\'s weight is measured in carats, with one carat being equivalent to 100 points. You will often see a diamond referred to as a 3/4-carat stone or a 75-point diamond. Larger stones are often more highly valued, but size should not be the only consideration--high brilliance, which varies according to clarity, cut, and color grade, is highly desirable in a diamond.Diamond Certification:A diamond certificate represents independent verification that the stone purchased has all the qualities of cut, color, clarity, shape, and weight expected. It is a further indication of the condition and value of that diamond as represented on our site. Such certificates are issued by several agencies employing highly trained gemologists and provide an unbiased and accurate evaluation of the diamond. These gemologists scrutinize each stone to analyze its dimensions, clarity, cut, color, finish, symmetry, and other details.Diamonds purchased from the Amazon.com Collection may be certified by the Gemological Institute of America or the International Gemological Institute. The type of certificate provided will be noted in the product specifications of your jewelry purchase; if you do not see a certificate type noted, one will not be provided.Our Diamond Policy:Amazon.com sources high-quality diamonds from some of the world\'s largest suppliers. All our diamond suppliers certify that to their best knowledge their diamonds are not conflict diamonds.Diamond Care:Diamonds, as the hardest substance on earth, are resistant to damage. However, diamond jewelry is set in different metals, and care will vary from piece to piece. Diamonds should be cleaned in a solution of one part ammonia to six parts water, using a gentle scrubbing brush to remove any dirt. It is a good idea to have them cleaned once a year by a professional jeweler, at which time the security of the setting can be checked as well. Diamond jewelry should be stored in a soft cloth pouch to ensure that the stone will not scratch other jewelry.Gold PurityThe purity of gold is measured in karats. Pure gold measures 24 karats but is too soft in this state to be used effectively in jewelry. So it is alloyed with other metals--silver, copper, nickel, and zinc--to increase its strength and durability. Common measurements once the alloy is added are 18 karat (75% gold), 14 karat (58%), and 10 karat (47.7%). In the United States, the legal karat limit for the metal to still be considered gold is 10 karats. A higher karat measurement in gold content indicates a greater value of the jewelry piece. Gold jewelry should always be stamped with the karat mark, either 18k, 750 (European marking for 18k), 14k, 585 (European marking for 14k), or 10k. In addition, to assure its quality, the piece should be stamped with the manufacturer\'s trademark or country of origin.Gold ColorThe color of gold may vary based off of the type of metal alloy included and the percentage of the metal alloy used. Most commonly, gold is available in yellow, white, and rose coloring.Yellow gold is the most common color and is usually alloyed with silver and copper. Yellow and white gold are similar in strength and malleability, making them perfect for jewelry that is worn daily.White gold is alloyed with nickel, copper, and zinc--and while it looks similar to platinum, it has vastly different properties.Rose-colored gold is alloyed with copper and is often used to accent white or yellow gold. The saturation of color varies from piece to piece and according to gold content.Caring For Your Gold JewelryTo keep gold shining and scratch-free, avoid contact with chlorine and other harsh chemicals. Do not wear jewelry during rough work and be sure to store it in a fabric-lined jewelry box or pouch. To clean gold jewelry, use warm water, a mild soap, and a soft bristled brush, if needed.', '268.57', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/313Rmr4DHeL.jpg', 86, 9, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

Cubic ZirconiaHistoryIn 1937, Cubic Zirconia was first discovered by German mineralogists, M. V. Stackelberg and K. Chudoba. Little did they know, the tiny crystals that they discovered would move on to become a popular synthetic gemstone. It wasn’t until the 1970s that Cubic Zirconia was first used in the jewelry world, when scientists began growing the crystals in the laboratory. In the 1980s, Cubic Zirconia use in jewelry continued to grow and today is it one of the most popular diamond substitutes available on the market.CompositionCubic Zirconia is the cubic form of zirconium oxide that is created in a laboratory. Its durable material allows the synthetic stone to be molded into a variety of shapes. The stone offers brilliant shine and flawless clarity. Cubic Zirconia is available in a wide range of colors, including a colorless form that is an economically important competitor to natural diamonds.Caring For Your Cubic Zirconia JewelryLike natural diamonds, Cubic Zirconia needs to be cared for in order to maintain its original brilliance and shine. Clean with warm-to-hot water and a soft brush with a mild soap, then immediately dry with a clean cloth after rinsing. Avoid contact with perfume, body lotion, hairspray or any other chemical that may harm the shine of the stone.', '99.00', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31rg1RuBKCL.jpg', 85, 9, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Diamond Clarity:No two diamonds are alike. A diamond\'s most distinguishing characteristics are its inclusions, marks that are often invisible to the naked eye. However, under a jeweler\'s magnifying loupe or microscope they can look like crystals, tiny rivers, or clouds. A diamond\'s clarity is determined by the presence or absence of inclusions--fewer inclusions mean better clarity--and how visible they are. The greater a diamond\'s clarity, the greater its brilliance and value. A diamond categorized as internally flawless will have no inclusions, but this is extremely rare.Diamond Color:Though diamonds come in a wide range of colors, colorless diamonds have traditionally been considered the most valuable. Most diamonds are graded on a scale using the letters of the alphabet, from D (colorless), the best grade, through Z (a light yellow). It is difficult for the untrained eye to notice such variations in color unless stones are being compared side by side.Diamond Carat Weight:A diamond\'s weight is measured in carats, with one carat being equivalent to 100 points. You will often see a diamond referred to as a 3/4-carat stone or a 75-point diamond. Larger stones are often more highly valued, but size should not be the only consideration--high brilliance, which varies according to clarity, cut, and color grade, is highly desirable in a diamond.Diamond Certification:A diamond certificate represents independent verification that the stone purchased has all the qualities of cut, color, clarity, shape, and weight expected. It is a further indication of the condition and value of that diamond as represented on our site.

GemstonesColorJewelers describe the color of a gemstone in terms of three characteristics: hue, saturation, and tone. A gemstone\'s basic color is its hue, and those with purer hues (for emeralds, green; for sapphires, blue; and for rubies, red) are generally considered more valuable. Often, however, a hint of another color can be detected. Saturation is a measure of the intensity or purity of a gem\'s hue and is determined by the degree to which gray or brown hues mute its defining color. Value tends to increase with saturation, so a fully saturated purplish blue sapphire may well be more expensive than a muted pure blue one. The tone of a gemstone, a measurement of its lightness or darkness, is usually given as light, medium-light, medium, medium-dark, or dark.ClarityA flawless gemstone is rare and expensive. As with diamonds, most gemstones have inclusions, or tiny mineral flaws, that can be seen under magnification or by the careful eye. Make sure that any inclusions in the stone do not penetrate deeply into the gem, as this may cause it to break or crack. Clarity grades range from VVS (very, very slightly included) to I3, in which inclusions are prominent and severely affect the gemstone\'s beauty.CutA gemstone\'s cut refers to its proportions and symmetry. In making a gemstone look appealing--the stone should be symmetrical in all dimensions so that it will appear balanced, and that its facets will reflect light evenly. Color should also be taken into account when cutting for optical efficiency. If a stone\'s color is highly saturated, a shallow cut will allow it to pass more light, while a deeper cut may increase the vividness of a less saturated gem. There is no generally accepted grading system for gemstone cut.SizeThough a gemstone\'s weight is usually given in carats, this may not give an accurate idea of its size, because different types of stone have different densities. Therefore, a one-carat sapphire or ruby will be smaller than a one-carat emerald, though they have the same weight, because sapphires and rubies (both a form of the mineral corundum) are more dense than emeralds.Gemstones can also be measured in dimensions (diameter, length, and width). It is important to know the dimensions to ensure that the gemstone weight will be visible and well-proportioned in the setting.Gemstone TreatmentGemstones are often treated to enhance color and fill cracks. Please note: if a gemstone has been treated, this information will be provided in the specifications on the stone\'s product detail page.There are various accepted techniques, depending on the type of stone:Oils and resins are frequently used to fill surface-reaching fissures in emeralds and rubies. This process is not permanent; however, if a treated ruby or emerald is subjected to high heat, the filler may leak out of the stone. Sapphires and rubies are often heated in a kiln or furnace to enhance their color. Such heat treatment, which is considered permanent, has been used for centuries.Lightly colored sapphires may also undergo diffusion treatment. This is done by heating a stone in the presence of coloring elements such as titanium or iron, which causes a thin layer of color to be diffused into the stone\'s surface. Because this color layer is so thin, a diffusion-treated sapphire should not be re-polished.Gemstone CareTo clean gemstone jewelry, first wipe it with a soft cloth to remove any dirt. Emeralds require only the use of a soft cloth, as cleaners may damage these soft gems. Sapphires and rubies can be cleaned with either an ultrasonic cleaner or a solution of one part ammonia to six parts water, with a soft brush. Store your gemstone jewelry in a soft cloth pouch or jewelry case so it does not touch other pieces in your collection. As with all jewelry, normal wear and tear can loosen prongs and settings, so it is a good idea to have it checked by a professional jeweler who can make repairs as needed.', '69.90', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31%2BkmwqQgLL.jpg', 71, 10, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Sterling Silver HistoryExperts believe that silver alloy, used today as sterling silver, originated in continental Europe in the 12th century. Pure silver was found to be a soft and easily damageable material. When combined with other metals, most commonly cooper, it produced a tougher material that could be heavily relied on. Throughout the next few centuries, sterling silver was used as currency and for household items. It was often used as silverware and became the material used in a proper table setting between 1840 and 1940 throughout the United States and Europe. Because of this popularity, silver companies began to grow. During this craze, companies began to experiment using sterling silver compositions in jewelry, as it was a material that was easy to mold into intricate designs and gave a luxurious look with its metallic finish. Today, sterling silver is widely used in all kinds of jewelry styles and shines as beautifully as other precious metals, with the benefit of affordable pricing.Sterling Silver CompositionWhile pure silver can be combined with many different types of metals, sterling silver is created when combining pure silver with copper. Sterling silver jewelry can be composed with different amounts of copper but is most often seen with the .925 stamp, meaning that the composition is of 92.5 percent silver and 7.5 percent copper. This has been found to be a good combination for maintaining the silver\'s durability without harming its sparkle.Caring for Your Sterling Silver JewelrySilver should not come into contact with harsh household chemicals such as bleach, ammonia, or chlorine. To avoid scratches, store silver in a lined jewelry box or pouch, as it is prone to tarnish as it naturally reacts with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide in the air. Cleaning and wearing silver jewelry regularly will prevent this and help maintain its shine. Immediately upon noticing any discoloration, use a gentle polish made specifically for removing tarnish.', '300.00', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Gfr%2BVElPL.jpg', 88, 10, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

A diamond categorized as internally flawless will have no inclusions, but this is extremely rare.Diamond Color:Though diamonds come in a wide range of colors, colorless diamonds have traditionally been considered the most valuable. Most diamonds are graded on a scale using the letters of the alphabet, from D (colorless), the best grade, through Z (a light yellow). It is difficult for the untrained eye to notice such variations in color unless stones are being compared side by side.Diamond Carat Weight:A diamond\'s weight is measured in carats, with one carat being equivalent to 100 points. You will often see a diamond referred to as a 3/4-carat stone or a 75-point diamond. Larger stones are often more highly valued, but size should not be the only consideration--high brilliance, which varies according to clarity, cut, and color grade, is highly desirable in a diamond.Diamond Certification:A diamond certificate represents independent verification that the stone purchased has all the qualities of cut, color, clarity, shape, and weight expected. It is a further indication of the condition and value of that diamond as represented on our site. Such certificates are issued by several agencies employing highly trained gemologists and provide an unbiased and accurate evaluation of the diamond. These gemologists scrutinize each stone to analyze its dimensions, clarity, cut, color, finish, symmetry, and other details.Diamonds purchased from the Amazon.com Collection may be certified by the Gemological Institute of America or the International Gemological Institute. The type of certificate provided will be noted in the product specifications of your jewelry purchase; if you do not see a certificate type noted, one will not be provided.Our Diamond Policy:Amazon.com sources high-quality diamonds from some of the world\'s largest suppliers. All our diamond suppliers certify that to their best knowledge their diamonds are not conflict diamonds.Diamond Care:Diamonds, as the hardest substance on earth, are resistant to damage. However, diamond jewelry is set in different metals, and care will vary from piece to piece. Diamonds should be cleaned in a solution of one part ammonia to six parts water, using a gentle scrubbing brush to remove any dirt. It is a good idea to have them cleaned once a year by a professional jeweler, at which time the security of the setting can be checked as well. Diamond jewelry should be stored in a soft cloth pouch to ensure that the stone will not scratch other jewelry.', '154.80', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31g9sQGB%2BgL.jpg', 84, 10, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Diamond Clarity:No two diamonds are alike. A diamond\'s most distinguishing characteristics are its inclusions, marks that are often invisible to the naked eye. However, under a jeweler\'s magnifying loupe or microscope they can look like crystals, tiny rivers, or clouds.

Pure silver was found to be a soft and easily damageable material. When combined with other metals, most commonly cooper, it produced a tougher material that could be heavily relied on. Throughout the next few centuries, sterling silver was used as currency and for household items. It was often used as silverware and became the material used in a proper table setting between 1840 and 1940 throughout the United States and Europe. Because of this popularity, silver companies began to grow. During this craze, companies began to experiment using sterling silver compositions in jewelry, as it was a material that was easy to mold into intricate designs and gave a luxurious look with its metallic finish. Today, sterling silver is widely used in all kinds of jewelry styles and shines as beautifully as other precious metals, with the benefit of affordable pricing.Sterling Silver CompositionWhile pure silver can be combined with many different types of metals, sterling silver is created when combining pure silver with copper. Sterling silver jewelry can be composed with different amounts of copper but is most often seen with the .925 stamp, meaning that the composition is of 92.5 percent silver and 7.5 percent copper. This has been found to be a good combination for maintaining the silver\'s durability without harming its sparkle.Caring for Your Sterling Silver JewelrySilver should not come into contact with harsh household chemicals such as bleach, ammonia, or chlorine. To avoid scratches, store silver in a lined jewelry box or pouch, as it is prone to tarnish as it naturally reacts with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide in the air. Cleaning and wearing silver jewelry regularly will prevent this and help maintain its shine. Immediately upon noticing any discoloration, use a gentle polish made specifically for removing tarnish.', '40.60', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31v8LIqSqFL.jpg', 39, 10, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),
